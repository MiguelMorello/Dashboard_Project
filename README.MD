Welcome to my Fullstack Dashboard project! This repository contains a web application that I used to learn and apply the Refine framework, along with other modern technologies.

## Project Description

This project is an interactive dashboard that allows you to efficiently visualize and manage data. The application is built with a fullstack architecture, using Refine for the user interface construction and a robust backend to handle data operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - [Refine](https://refine.dev/) - React framework for building applications.
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Library for building user interfaces

- **Backend:**
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment.
    - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - Query language for APIs, providing a more efficient and flexible alternative to REST.

- **Other Technologies:**
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - For application containerization.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Version control.

## Features

- Real-time data visualization.
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for records.
- Filters and search to facilitate data navigation.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.
